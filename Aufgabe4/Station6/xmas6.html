                    "Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
                    But the very next day, you gave it away
                    This year, to save me from tears
                    I'll give it to someone special
                    Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

                    This year, to save me from tears
                    I'll give it to someone special
                    Once bitten and twice shy
                    I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
                    Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
                    "Merry Christmas" I wrapped it up and sent it
                </p>

                <p>
                    With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
                    Now I know what a fool I've been
                    But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
                </p>

                    This year, to save me from tears"
